# Abstract

Temporal micro-action localization involves identifying brief actions in videos, crucial for applications such as medical diagnostics. A typical example is video-based swallowing disorder diagnosis, which requires detecting micro-actions (e.g., hyoid motion, {'<'}2s) to identify abnormalities. This task is extremely challenging, presenting two key aspects: 1) Temporal complexity. Micro-actions are extremely short and often co-occur in lengthy videos. 2) Spatial ambiguity. Subtle anatomical movements are obscured by noise and blurred contours in X-ray images. Existing methods struggle with fine-grained temporal modeling and fail to focus on key anatomical structures. To address these issues, we propose Skeleton-Guided Mamba for Temporal Micro-Action Localization (SG-Mamba), a framework that integrates (1) a Mamba-based architecture for efficient short- and long-term temporal modeling and (2) skeleton heatmap sequences to suppress noise and enhance key anatomical focus. Additionally, we propose a Channel-enhanced Cross-Mamba (CCM) block for effective cross-modality interaction with a Channel-wise Enhancement (CE) module to refine channel-wise representations. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the previous micro-action localization method by 14.4% in average mAP.

# Abstract

Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) is the gold standard for assessing swallowing disorders,
enabling detailed analysis of swallowing phases.
Temporal micro-action localization in VFSS, which needs to identify and localize micro-actions
(e.g., hyoid motion, {'<'}2s), is critical for diagnosis but faces significant challenges: 1) **Spatial ambiguity**. Subtle anatomical movements are obscured by noise and blurred contours in X-ray images. 2) **Temporal complexity**. Micro-actions are extremely short, making them difficult to localize in lengthy videos.
Existing methods detect the whole swallowing before localizing micro-actions or trim videos to handle brief actions.
However, they fail to focus on key anatomical structures and struggle with efficient spatiotemporal modeling.
To address these issues, we propose Channel-enhanced Cross-Mamba (CCM), a framework that integrates 1) skeleton heatmap sequences to suppress noise and enhance key anatomical focus, and 2) a Mamba-based architecture with Channel-enhanced Cross-Mamba(CCM) to fuse the appearance features with skeleton guidance, enabling rich spatiotemporal features through efficient bidirectional modeling. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the previous method by 14.4\% in average mAP.
